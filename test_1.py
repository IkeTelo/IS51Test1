The program is trying to determin which payment option is better (more money).
First option is 100 dollers per day for 10 days; Second option is 
for 1 doller a day with it being doubled each day for 10 days. There
will be two functions to calculate, the pay rate.
function1 will calculate the amount for the first option, function2
will calculate for the second option

function1 will output $100 x 10 days.
funchtion2 will loop 10 times, with each time doubling the amount and add the amount to the total

if the amount is equal, we output to the user "Option 1 and Option 2 pays the same"
if the Option1 is better, we output to the user "Option1 is better"
if the Option2 is better, we output to the user "Option2 is better"
